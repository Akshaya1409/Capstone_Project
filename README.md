# Cloud Classification For Weather Prediction Using Deep Learning 


Weather condition is an important factor that is considered for various decisions.Deep learning and computer vision can assist in classifying cloud images that do not depend on weather forecast information from the internet

This project aims to build a multi class classification model for predicting weather from still image provided by the user that has crucial real life application such as environmental monitoring,distinguishing weather phenomenon that can improve local  agriculture.
